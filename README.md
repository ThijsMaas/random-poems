# random-poems
Creating random poems from random internet thoughts

This is a personal project to create random poems by scraping websites like twitter and reddit.
I will implement different versions of rhymers, maybe even haikus

The goal is to make a module for a magic mirror to display a different random poem each day/hour/whatever.
